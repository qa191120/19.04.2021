          1
         create a string and put null inside it
         create a function that gets a string as input and tries to print the half size of the string
         call this function from main
         which exception did you get?
         surround the function call (from main) with try-catch
         run the code and check that the program does not crash
        
         2
         create a function that gets a string as input and tries to print the half size of the string
         printHalf(String sentence)
         if sentence is null then throw the exception you got
         in question 1
        
          3
         create an Exception class called WrongHalfStringInput
         which extends RuntimeException
         in method 2 throw this exception (instead of the previous)
         
         4
         copy the 3 methods into a designated class (like we did in class)
         
         5
         create test (like we did in class) for all positive/negative flows (including exceptions)
         for all three methods
